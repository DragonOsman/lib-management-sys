# DragonOsman Library Management System App (Refactor of existing Github Project)

This is my take on a library management system MERN app, which I wrote as a refactor of [this](https://github.com/cjchirag7/lib_management) code on GitHub.  Currently a work in progress, as I still need to do the client-side React code.  It'll be a MERN app with React and Typescript on the front-end, whereas the code I'm trying to use as a base doesn't use Typescript. I also won't use Redux like the original app does because I don't like to use that when the React Context API exists.

I'm also making mine a generic library management system that can be used anywhere, not just in a library, which is why I changed all mentions of "student" in this app to "patron".
